## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{R}
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
activity  <- read.csv("activity.csv", header=TRUE, 
                      colClasses=c("numeric", "character", "integer"))
activity$date  <- ymd(activity$date)

```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{R}
library(ggplot2)

steps <- activity %>%
    filter(!is.na(steps)) %>%
    group_by(date) %>%
    summarize(steps = sum(steps)) %>%
    print()

ggplot(steps, aes(x=steps)) + geom_histogram(fill="royalblue2", binwidth=1000) +
    labs(title="Histogram", x="Steps Per Day", y="N") 

steps_mean <- mean(steps$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
steps_med <- median(steps$steps, na.rm = TRUE)

print(c("Mean Steps:", steps_mean))
print(c("Median Steps:", steps_med))
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
